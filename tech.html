Twitters New IPO
Written By Dillon Spiro. March 3rd, 2016.</b></i>
</b>.</br></br>
<font face="Times New Roman"> <font size="2"> 
On Thursday, shares of social media company Twitter dropped below their IPO price of $26. The intraday low was $25.94 a share. Shares later ended the day down 5.8 percent at $26.

Twitter went public on Nov. 7, 2013, and ended its first trading day at $44.94 (up 72.84 percent).

Last month, co-founder and interim CEO Jack Dorsey said in an earnings release that the company was facing problems growing its user base.

"Our Q2 results show good progress in monetization, but we are not satisfied with our growth in audience," he said. "In order to realize Twitter's full potential, we must improve in three key areas: ensure more disciplined execution, simplify our service to deliver Twitter's value faster and better communicate that value."
</br>
The company has lost about half of its value in just four months, since April 8. The stock has continued to slip on the news of poor performance and uncertainty around its leadership.

However, the stock did get a boost last week when an SEC filing showed that Dorsey had purchased 31,627 shares of the company.
</br>
Notably, Dorsey is just one of several Twitter insiders to buy the stock in recent days. That could signal the board and executive team are making a bet that this is the bottom for the stock. According to a separate SEC filing, board member Peter Currie purchased 9,200 shares on Friday.<However, Dorsey's purchase came after he had sold around 400,000 shares in the last couple of quarters amid turbulence after Dick Costolo stepped down as CEO and stock dropped.</br> Hooke objected that Newton had not conducted enough experiments and that other theories(his own) could explain phenomena just as well.
</br>
Because of Newton's religion, he was not allowed to marry or have any relations.
Apart from science, Newton also had interests in alchemy, mysticism and theology.
</br> Newton's mother left when he was a very young boy and only came back later on after her second husband died. His father died before he was born.
Newton was given a state funeral, his body was burried in Westminster Abbey in London with the nobles. I chose to research Sir Isaac Newton because I heard so much about him that I wanted to go more in depth and find out how he specifically helped society aswell as science.
